{"ALG_DESC": "Converts the first band of a raster to a XML encoded X3D GeoElevationgrid file. The raster is expected to contain elevation data. Please see Help for more detail and guidance.", "significant_digits_in_output": "Can be used to reduce the size of the output file. Often 4 digits are sufficient, eg. when only a one meter accuracy is required. ", "ALG_CREATOR": "(c) Andreas Plesch 2017", "smooth_rendering": "Smooth appearance by default. Set to false for creased appearance. Smoothed rendering is actually faster. ", "X3D_GeoElevationGrid_file": "The name of the generated XML X3D GeoElevationgrid file. The generated X3D node uses a non-standard negative zSpacing field value to avoid reversing the order of elevation data in the source raster. This would lead to inverted normals but the ccw is also set to false which should compensate. The solid field is set to false to allow display of backfaces. The metadata field is populated with a MetaDataset which has useful information such as the attribution if given in the source layer or the name of the source file.", "ALG_VERSION": "0.2", "ALG_HELP_CREATOR": "Andreas Plesch", "vertical_exaggeration": "A factor by which elevation values are exaggerated for display purposes. The default of 1 means no exaggeration which often is not what is expected in a visualization. Use a factor of 3.28 to convert from feet to meters if the data are provided in feeet (unlikely). Since X3D automatically converts geographic coordinates to meters there is no need to use this factor to try to correct for the mismatch between degrees and meters.", "DEM_raster_layer": "A raster layer which is expected to contain elevation data in meters (but see vertical exaggeration) in its first band. X3D only allows for geographic or UTM coordinates. Rasters with other CRSs are rejected. Similarly, X3D does not recognize all earth spheroids, see http://www.web3d.org/documents/specifications/19775-1/V3.3/Part01/components/geodata.html#t-earthellipsoids .\nWarp raster to geographic or UTM coordinates, WGS84 if the script bails with such a warning.\nTypically, DEMs are large but X3D can typically only handle 500x500 values. There will be warning for larger rasters but the the file will still be generated.  "}
